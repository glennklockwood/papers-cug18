To demonstrate the simplicity of deploying pytokio on different Cray systems, results from both NERSC's Cori and ALCF's Theta systems will also be presented.  Furthermore, because pytokio is BSD-licensed, new connectors to site-specific tools can be developed to suit the needs of different centers.  Full pytokio source code, ready-to-deploy packages, and broadly useful analysis applications will all be referenced.
